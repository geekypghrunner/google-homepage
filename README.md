This project is to recreate the Google.com homepage following basic CSS and HTML conventions.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

What I learned:
1. Always first check for syntax errors when a code initally does not work.  Missing semi-colons and end tags make a big difference.
2. Use the Inspection tool in the web browser to determine correct pixel adjustments prior to making changes in the code.
3. Practice patience and accept that Google has most answers.
